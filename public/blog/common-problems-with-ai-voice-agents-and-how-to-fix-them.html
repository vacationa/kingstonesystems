                <p>
                    <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Users experience long delays between speaking and hearing responses, conversations feel slow and unnatural, or users interrupt responses because they think the system isn't responding.
                </p>

                <h3>Root Causes</h3>
                <p>
                    High latency can result from multiple factors:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Slow Model Inference:</strong> Large, unoptimized AI models requiring extensive computation can create delays in response generation.

                <p>
                    <strong>Inefficient Infrastructure:</strong> CPU-based inference, lack of GPU acceleration, or suboptimal infrastructure configuration can slow processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Network Latency:</strong> Geographic distance, slow network connections, or inefficient data transmission can add delays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sequential Processing:</strong> Processing stages executed sequentially rather than in parallel can compound latency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Inefficient End-of-Speech Detection:</strong> Waiting too long to detect speech completion before processing adds unnecessary delay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Resource Contention:</strong> High load, insufficient resources, or resource contention can slow processing.
                </p>

                <h3>Diagnostic Methods</h3>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Measure Component Latencies:</strong> Instrument your system to measure latency at each stage—ASR, model inference, TTS, network—to identify bottlenecks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Analyze Latency Distributions:</strong> Examine latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99) to understand typical vs. worst-case performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Monitor Resource Usage:</strong> Track CPU, GPU, memory, and network usage to identify resource constraints or contention.

                <p>
                    <strong>3. Use Streaming Architectures:</strong> Implement streaming ASR, streaming model inference, and streaming TTS to begin responses immediately rather than waiting for complete processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>4. Optimize End-of-Speech Detection:</strong> Use efficient voice activity detection (VAD) to detect speech completion faster, reducing wait time before processing begins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>5. Implement Parallel Processing:</strong> Process components in parallel where possible—begin model inference as ASR results stream in, start TTS as model outputs become available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>6. Use Edge Computing:</strong> Deploy processing closer to users to reduce network latency. Use edge computing for latency-critical components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>7. Optimize Infrastructure:</strong> Use optimized inference engines (TensorRT, ONNX Runtime), efficient serving architectures, and proper resource allocation to minimize latency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>8. Implement Caching:</strong> Cache frequently used responses, precompute common operations, and use response caching to eliminate latency for predictable scenarios.
                </p>
