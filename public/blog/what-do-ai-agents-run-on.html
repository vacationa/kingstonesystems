                <h2>Deployment Architectures: How AI Agents Are Deployed</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding deployment architectures helps clarify where and how AI agents actually run. Different architectures have different implications for infrastructure, scalability, and control.
                </p>

                <h3>Fully Managed Platform Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                    Some AI agents run entirely on managed platforms that handle all infrastructure, hosting, and operational concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How It Works:</strong> You configure and customize the agent through platform interfaces, and it runs entirely on the platform's infrastructure. You don't manage servers, databases, or infrastructure directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Examples:</strong> Voiceflow, many chatbot platforms, and SaaS AI agent services operate this way. Your agent runs on their servers, using their infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pros:</strong> No infrastructure management, automatic scaling, built-in reliability, faster time to market, lower initial technical requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cons:</strong> Less control, platform lock-in, potential limitations, ongoing platform fees, limited customization options.
                </p>

                <h3>Cloud-Hosted Custom Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                    Many organizations build custom agents using frameworks like LangChain and deploy them on cloud infrastructure they control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How It Works:</strong> You develop the agent code, deploy it to cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure), manage the infrastructure, and connect to LLM APIs and other services. The agent runs on your cloud resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Examples:</strong> Custom agents built with LangChain deployed on AWS Lambda, agents in Docker containers on cloud VMs, or serverless functions on cloud platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pros:</strong> Full control, customization flexibility, no platform lock-in, can optimize costs and performance, integrates with your infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cons:</strong> Requires infrastructure management, more development effort, operational overhead, need to handle scaling and reliability yourself.
                </p>

                <h3>Hybrid Architectures</h3>
                <p>
                    Many production agents use hybrid approaches, combining managed services with custom infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How It Works:</strong> Core agent logic runs on your infrastructure, but you leverage managed services for specific components—LLM APIs, vector databases, voice processing, etc. This balances control with operational simplicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Examples:</strong> Custom agent code on AWS Lambda calling OpenAI API, using Pinecone for vector storage, Deepgram for voice processing, but managing orchestration and business logic yourself.
                </p>

                <h3>Edge and On-Premises Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                    Some agents run on edge devices or on-premises infrastructure for latency, privacy, or compliance reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How It Works:</strong> Agent code runs on local servers, edge devices, or on-premises infrastructure. May use self-hosted LLMs or still call cloud APIs depending on requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Use Cases:</strong> Low-latency requirements, data privacy regulations, air-gapped environments, or cost optimization for very high volumes.
                </p>

                <h2>Infrastructure Requirements by Scale</h2>
                <p>
                    What AI agents run on varies significantly based on scale and requirements. Understanding infrastructure needs at different scales helps plan deployments.
                </p>

                <h3>Small-Scale Deployments (Low Volume)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Traffic:</strong> Hundreds to low thousands of conversations per month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Cloud Functions), small databases, minimal infrastructure overhead. May use fully managed platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Costs:</strong> $50-$500/month for infrastructure, primarily API costs for LLM usage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Requirements:</strong> Minimal infrastructure management, automatic scaling handled by serverless platforms, simple deployment processes.
                </p>

                <h3>Medium-Scale Deployments (Moderate Volume)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Traffic:</strong> Thousands to tens of thousands of conversations per month.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Understanding what AI agents run on includes considering how infrastructure choices impact performance and scalability.
                </p>

                <h3>Latency Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    Different use cases have different latency requirements, which influence infrastructure choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Real-Time Conversations:</strong> Voice agents and live chat require sub-second response times, necessitating optimized infrastructure, geographic proximity, and efficient API usage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Asynchronous Interactions:</strong> Email agents or batch processing can tolerate longer latencies, allowing for different infrastructure trade-offs.
                </p>

                <h3>Scaling Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Horizontal Scaling:</strong> Adding more servers/containers to handle increased load. Requires stateless design and load balancing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Vertical Scaling:</strong> Increasing resources on existing servers. Simpler but has limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Auto-Scaling:</strong> Automatic scaling based on demand, essential for variable traffic patterns.
                </p>

                <h3>High Availability</h3>
                <p>
                    Production agents require redundancy, failover capabilities, and geographic distribution to ensure reliability. This influences infrastructure architecture significantly.
                </p>

                <h2>Security and Compliance Infrastructure</h2>
                <p>
                    What AI agents run on must also support security and compliance requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>Data Security</h3>
                <p>
                    Infrastructure must support encryption at rest and in transit, secure API communications, access controls, and data protection measures.
                </p>

                <h3>Compliance Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2 require specific infrastructure capabilities—data residency, audit logging, access controls, data retention policies.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion: Understanding What AI Agents Run On</h2>
                <p>
                    What AI agents run on is a complex stack involving LLM APIs, cloud infrastructure, databases, integration services, and orchestration layers. There's no single answer—different agents run on different combinations of technologies depending on requirements, scale, use case, and architectural choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key is understanding that modern AI agents typically leverage distributed, cloud-based architectures rather than running on single servers. They combine managed services (LLM APIs, platforms) with custom infrastructure (hosting, databases, orchestration) to create complete systems. Understanding these layers helps you make informed decisions about technology choices, infrastructure design, and deployment strategies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When building or evaluating AI agents, consider the complete stack—not just the LLM but all supporting infrastructure. The choice of platforms, frameworks, hosting, and services significantly impacts capabilities, costs, scalability, and operational complexity. Understanding what AI agents run on provides the foundation for building effective, scalable, and maintainable AI agent systems.
